<H2>1. Setting up the game</H2>
<P>When starting the game you will be faced with a window like this:</P>
<IMG SRC="/star_of_Africa/docs/menu.png">
<H3>1.1. Player type</H3>
<P>Player type simply refers to whether the player in question is a
flesh-and-blood human, or a computer AI player. At first the computer-option is
grayed out, because the first player must always be human, but after that one
is free to choose. When selecting the computer-option almost every other option
will be grayed out, since the computer will choose these by itself.</P>
<P>Writing in the player's name is optional, but it might be more fun to play
as Anne or Bob, than as Player 1 and 2. The computer players will always just
be Player N, so don't bother trying to give them names.</P>

<H3>1.2. Starting point</H3>
<P>The player may start at 2 different locations of the map, Tangier and Cairo.
The former lies in the northwestern part of the map, the latter in the
northeastern. Which one you pick doesn't have any major impact on the game
(at least not statistically speaking).</P>

<H3>1.3. The Gamepiece</H3>
<P>Oooh. Shiny colours. Pick your favourite. This selection has no impact on
the gameplay whatsoever.</P>

<H3>1.4. The buttons</H3>
<P>When you're satified with all the selections above, and want to add the
player to the game click the &quot;Add player&quot; button. The player will
then be added with the options you just picked, and you can start setting the
options for the next one. When you click this button the gamepiece that player
had chosen will be grayed out, because for the sake of clarity, two players
can not have the same colour gamepiece.</P>
<P>When you've added all the players you want to have, just click the
&quot;Start game&quot; button. This button can not be clicked until the minimum
number of players (2) has been added. When the maximum amount of players (5)
has been added everything <I>but</I> this button becomes unclickable.</P>

<H2>2. Playing the game</H2>
<P>When the game begins the player(s) will be presented with a window containing
the game board to the left, and the statistics and controls to the right.</P>
<H3>2.1. The map</H3>
<P>The map shows where the players are, where the unopened tokens are, and of
course it displays the routes which the players can move on. The map starts at
a zoom level of 100%, which can be adjusted by moving the slider. If the map
becomes too big to fit the window, scrollbars will appear which will allow the
players to view the entire area.</P>

<H3>2.2. The statistics window</H3>
<P>In the right hand panel each player has his own status window which holds
the player's name, gamepiece and current monetary status. The window will also
be updated with the tokens the player has drawn, so that it's easy to get a
picture of who has drawn what, and how many tokens there are left of each
kind. The statistics window also tells everyone whose turn it is by framing
that player's window in red. The players appear in the order the computer has
selected by chance, and the topmost player is the one who gets to start. After
that the turn proceeds downwards to the next player, and so on. When all players
have had their turn, the next round starts from the top.</P>

<H3>2.3. The event window</H3>
<P>The event window will display the events that occur during gameplay. Typical
events that will be displayed are dicerolls and the opening of tokens. Just
beneath the event window is a field that will display comments regarding the
events. Most of the time it will only affirm the events, but sometimes also
display information not directly visible in the event window (e.g. the player
getting captured by pirates).</P>

<H3>2.4. The controls</H3>
<P>The control buttons are for the most part pretty self-explanatory. When a
player wishes to move by land, he simply needs to roll the dice. After this the
computer will calculate all the places that the diceroll in question allows the
player to move to, and encircle these in red. The player may then click inside
the red circle where he wishes to move.</P>
<P>Should a player wish to turn a token by diceroll (only possible if he is
standing on a token, and has not yet moved this turn) he must first make sure
that the &quot;Roll for token&quot;-option is enabled, and then roll the dice.
If the roll produces a 4 or higher, the token will be turned.</P>

<P>If the player lands on a token after making his move he will be given the
opportunity to buy the token, provided he has the money. This transaction can be
performed by a simple click on the corresponding button.</P>

<P>If the player wants to board a ship or a plane he must click the appropriate
button, and then select his destination. In the case of air travel he will
immediately be transported to his destination. In the case of sea travel he must
then roll the dice, and move where the dice takes him. In both cases the fare
for travel will automatically be deducted from the player's account.</P>

<P>When a player has performed an action and no longer can, or wants to do
anything he may hand the turn over to the next player by clicking &quot;End 
turn&quot;</P>

<H2>3. Starting a new game</H2>
<P>When a game is finished two buttons will appear on both sides of the zoom
slider. These allow the player to quit the game, or starting a new one. By
default the &quot;Same players&quot; box is ticked, and this means starting a
new game with the same players as in the previous one. The order of the players
will be reshuffled, as will the tokens, but otherwise the game will be the same.
(This includes the starting positions that the players chose for the game.)
Should the players wish to change the setup, the may simply remove the tick,
in which case they will be presented with the same setup menu as when starting
the program.</P>

<H2>4. Strategic tips</H2>
<P>The Star of Africa is obviously a game that depends heavily on luck. That
does not mean that using a strategy is impossible. Here are a few tips that
may increase your chance of winning.</P>
<UL>
<LI>Since all tokens carry the same chance of being the Star, the player who
gets the most tokens has the highest probability of finding it. For this reason
you should always plan ahead. The nearest token isn't always the best one. You
should also consider where the others are likely to move.
<LI>If possible, move to locations where there are many tokens and few other
players. Being in a crowd puts you at a severe disadvantage should you encounter
a robber, since players who don't have money will have to wait <I>at least</I>
one turn to turn a token, whereas players with money don't.
<LI>Taking the above into consideration, it's usually wise to choose the less
crowded starting point.
<LI>The winner is the one who returns with the Star, not the one with the most
money - therefore money is meant to be spent. While it's not a good thing to be
flat broke, having large sums of &pound;1000+ and not using them just adds to
the bitterness when they're taken by a robber. Instead the money should be spent
on flying to good locations where one can pick up lots of tokens quickly.
<LI>Again considering the above - if you can buy a token, do so. One of the few
cases where it might be wise not to, is when you're on an island with only
&pound;100 left.
<LI>Do what you can do, not what you can't. If the game hasn't been going well,
and you're out of money, while several others are competing for the remaining
tokens in the south, it might be a good idea to head for that single token
that was left behind in the Sahara. If you're lucky it just might be the Star,
or if somebody else finds the Star, it could be a horseshoe, and you're close
to home while the others are far south.
