<H2>1. Foreword</H2>
<P>This game is a computer adaptation of the Finnish board game &quot;Afrikan
 t&auml;hti&quot; originally created by Kari Mannerla. The rules that came with
 the original game were brief and simple - so simple as to being ambiguous
 in certain situations. E.g. they took no stance as to the question whether
 a player is allowed to continue &quot;on the fly&quot; from a sea route to
 a land route. The game has therefore been played with countless small
 variations in Finnish homes throughout the decades, the players simply
 deciding beforehand on the minutiae of the rules. Such disambiguation is
 naturally not acceptable when making a computer game, and therefore the
 player is encouraged to read through <I>these</I> rules, even should he
 already be aquainted with the game.</P>

<P>It should also be noted that in 2005 the original rules were officially
 amended with a rule stating that a pennyless player may still use sea routes,
 moving 2 steps per turn without rolling the dice. This game however follows
 the original rules which do not allow this. A future version may include the
 option to choose which ruleset to use, but for now it's the old rules that
 count.</P>

<H2>2. The general setting</H2>
<P>The star of Africa is a board game for 2-5 players, out of which at least
 one must be human. The rest can either be human or computer AI players. The
 game is regarded suitable for players of age 4 and up.
 The board consists of a map of Africa, with routes connecting the various
 places by land, sea and air. There are 30 places (cities) on the map that
 contain tokens, which may be collected by the players. The tokens are shuffled
 and placed face down - one on each city - before the game begins. (The computer
does this automatically.)</P>
<P>Before the game starts all players must choose whether to start at Tangier
or Cairo (marked with big red circles on the board). The objective of the game
is to find the token that
holds the Star of Africa, and return with it to either one of the starting
points. In the original game, the players determined the starting order by
diceroll. In the computer version the order is automatically randomized by the
computer.</P>

<H2>3. Moving</H2>
<H3>3.1. Moving by land</H3>
<P>A player may move by land by rolling the dice, and moving the number of steps
indicated by the dice. Should the player on his path, come upon a city he may,
should he so choose, stop in the city even if the number of steps taken were
fewer than indicated by the dice.</P>

<H3>3.2. Moving by sea</H3>
<P>A player may move by sea by paying the &pound;100 boarding fee, which is the
same regardless of the distance traveled, and then rolling the dice, and moving
 on the blue sea tiles, the number of steps indicated by the dice. After
 boarding a ship he is then shipbound for the destination he chose, and may not
 change the destination, even if the sea route in question diverges in a
 manner that would make a destination change possible, was it a land route. 
(After all he is just a passenger on a ship, and the ship won't change course
 just because a passenger changed his mind.)</P>
<P>Both boarding and disembarking take some time, and a player may therefore not
board or disembark &quot;on the fly&quot;. I.e. to use dice points exceeding
 either the source or the destination of the sea route, to move on land.</P>
 
 <P><b>UPDATE 2014:</b> The current rules allow boarding a ship, and advancing up to two steps per turn without payment. You may not decide to pay the fare after boarding in order to speed up the trip.</P>

<H3>3.3. Moving by air</H3>
<P>A player may move along the air routes (red lines connecting two cities) by
 paying the &pound;300 boarding fee, and moving his gamepiece to the destination
 without rolling the dice. Just like with the fee for boarding a ship, the fee
 is the same regardless of the distance traveled.</P>

<H2>4. The tokens</H2>
<H3>4.1. Opening a token</H3>
<P>A player may open a token he is standing on by either paying &pound;100 or
 - if he is out of money, or for some reason does not want to spend the money
 he has - by rolling the dice and getting a 4 or higher. A diceroll spent on
 turning a token may not be used for moving regardless of whether the roll was
 a success or not. For this reason the intent to roll for the token must always
 be signalled prior to rolling.</P>
<P>The player may buy the token immediately upon arriving, provided he has the
 necessary funds to do so. Should he desire to open the token by diceroll, he
 must however await the next turn. If the player starts his turn, with money in
his pocket, on a token that he for whatever reason decided not to buy the
previous turn, he may buy it immediately if he so chooses, but he may no longer
move that turn. He may also not buy the token on the same turn as making a
failed attempt at opening it by rolling.</P>

<H3>4.2. Token types</H3>
<P>There are 7 different kinds of tokens, each having its own significance:</P>
<TABLE BORDER="1">
<TR><TD><B>Token</B></TD><TD><B>Number of tokens</B></TD><TD><B>Effect</B></TD></TR>
<TR><TD>Blank</TD><TD>12</TD><TD>Nothing happens.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>Horseshoe</TD><TD>5</TD><TD>Prior to the discovery of the Star,<BR>nothing happens. After the discovery<BR>it serves as a substitute for the Star.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>Robber</TD><TD>3</TD><TD>Player loses all his money.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>Topaz (Yellow gemstone)</TD><TD>4</TD><TD>Player receives &pound;300.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>Emerald (Green gemstone)</TD><TD>3</TD><TD>Player receives &pound;500.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>Ruby (Red gemstone)</TD><TD>2</TD><TD>Player receives &pound;1000.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>The Star of Africa (Very big diamond)</TD><TD>1</TD><TD>Player may now race to one of the<BR>starting points in order to win.</TD></TR>
</TABLE>

<H2>5. Special places</H2>
<P>The following places carry special significance:</P>
<UL>
<LI><B>Gold Coast</B> - Gemstones found here are worth twice their oridinary
 value.
<LI><B>Slave Coast</B> - A player who draws a blank token here will be enslaved
 and unable to move for 3 turns.
<LI><B>Capetown</B> - The first player to arrive here will receive a &pound;500
 bonus.
<LI><B>St. Helena</B> - The tiles on both sides of the island (marked with dark
 circles) are pirate infested waters. Any player who lands upon these will be
 captured until he manages to roll a 1 or 2.
<LI><B>Sahara desert</B> - The tile 2 steps east of Sahara (marked with a dark
 circle) is the home of hostile beduins. A player who lands here will be
 captured until he rolls a 1 or 2.
</UL>

<H2>6. Players unable to win</H2>
<P>A player who doesn't have even a theoretical chance of winning the game is
 removed from the game. His gamepiece will be left where it was, his status 
 will be set to &quot;STRANDED&quot;, and he will no longer be given a turn
 to do anything. This happens if any of the following scenarios occur:</P>
<UL>
<LI>The player becomes stranded on an island without any means to get off. (The
 classical way to get stranded is picking up a robber on St. Helena.)
<LI>The player becomes &quot;stranded&quot; on the mainland without money,
 while all the remaining tokens are on islands. The player in question has
 neither the Star nor an effective substitute.
<LI>The Star of Africa has been found, as have all the 5 horseshoes. The player
 in question has neither the Star nor an effective substitute.
</UL>
<P>Should all players become unable to win, the game is declared over without
 a winner being declared.</P>

<H2>7. Winning</H2>
<P>The first player to transport either the Star of Africa, or a horseshoe
 found <I>after</I> the discovery of the Star, to either one of the starting
 points (Tangier or Cairo) is the winner.</P>
<UL>
<LI>A player does not have to return to the same place he started from. Either
starting point will do.
<LI>Just like with the cities, it is <I>not</I> required that the player roll
 the exact number of steps that will take him to the finish line. Rolling that
 number or greater is sufficient.
<LI>There can be only one winner. Finishing &quot;on the same turn&quot; as the
 winner does not count as a draw.
<LI>If all the horseshoes have been discovered by the time the Star is found
 and the discoverer himself isn't stranded, he will instantly be declared the
 winner.
<LI>Robbers only steal the player's money. They do not take the Star or the
 horseshoe substitutes.
